description: "I expanded the 2\xD72 V-BLAST zero-forcing scheme to a general\
  \ MxM scheme. For a general MxM matrix, the inverse cannot be precalculated by hand\
  \ as I did for the 1\xD71 and 2\xD72 scheme. The inversion of a possibly large channel\
  \ matrix can quickly get a very complex problem which needs a lot of computation\
  \ power, especially if it is recalculated frequently, for example each micro second\
  \ when assuming a coherence time of 1\u03BCs and therefore a CSI update rate of\
  \ 1MHz."
