  \ YAML generator has been added to the modtool. A new CLI command, update, has been\
  \ added to the existing modtool commands that serves the purpose of conversion of\
  \ XML scripts to YAML scripts. The functionality can also be achieved through the\
  \ API class, ModToolUpdate. I would like to thank my mentors and H\xE5kon V\xE5\
  gsether for helping me throughout."
