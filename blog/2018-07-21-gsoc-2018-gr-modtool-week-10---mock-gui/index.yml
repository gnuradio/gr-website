description: "GSoC 2018 gr-modtool - As planned for Week 10, I have created\
  \ a mock GUI for the modtool. I have also added the commits from the branch yaml,\
  \ which contained the cli and core modules for the XML to YAML conversion, into\
  \ the branch swapnil_next\u200B. I have also condensed all the remaining work of\
  \ the other PRs into the main PR."
