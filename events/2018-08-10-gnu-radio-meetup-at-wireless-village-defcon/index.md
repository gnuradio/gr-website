#GNU Radio Meetup Hosted by Wireless Village @ DEF CON

##Date: August 10, 2018 19:00-22:00 
##Location: Wireless Village @ DEF CON 

In conjunction with the Wireless Village Crew, members of the GNU Radio project will be holding a meetup at the Wireless Village during the DEF CON conference, starting at 7:00 PM on Friday, August 10. This is an informal social event to meet, greet, discuss, get to know us and fellow GNU Radio users, and generally have a good time. Punctuality is not important and there will be no formal seating or organized schedule. Just come by when you can for however long you wish. The meetup has no cost and is free to attend, however, a DEF CON badge is required. 

We hope to see you there!
